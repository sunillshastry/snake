There are a couple of ways to run, and use the application - I have included steps to run both the ways.
1. Clone the project using `git clone` command, or just click the _"Download"_ option above.
2. Make sure you have installed OpenJDK 16.0 or a higher version. Failure to install the required version may result in unexpected behavior of the program.
3. After having the project cloned, `cd` into the project and navigate to the **"JAR"** directory that is present in the root directory of the folder.
4. To execute and run via the terminal using a command, enter `java -jar SnakeGame.jar` and the window will automatically open.
5. Or, simply navigate to the project directory and double-click on the `SnakeGame.jar` file present inside the **JAR** folder.
6. The program should run successfully without causing any unexpected results.
